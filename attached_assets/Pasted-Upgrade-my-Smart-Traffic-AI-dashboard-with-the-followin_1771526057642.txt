Upgrade my Smart Traffic AI dashboard with the following changes:

1. Remove video upload feature completely.
2. Add image upload feature for traffic detection.
3. When user uploads an image:
   - Simulate AI detection.
   - Detect number of pedestrians.
   - Detect number of vehicles.
   - Update sliders automatically based on detection.
   - Recalculate signal timing.

Signal Logic Requirements:

Create adaptive signal control logic:

Let:
baseTime = 25

Green time should increase based on:
- vehicles count
- pedestrians count
- peak hour toggle

New logic:

let time = baseTime;

if (vehicles > 20) time += 10;
if (vehicles > 40) time += 15;

if (pedestrians > 10) time += 5;
if (pedestrians > 25) time += 10;

if (peakHour) time += 5;

// Cap maximum green time
time = Math.min(time, 60);

Signal Switching Rules:

- If pedestrians > vehicles:
    Vehicles light = RED
    Pedestrian crossing active
- If vehicles > pedestrians:
    Vehicles light = GREEN
    Pedestrian light = RED
- If both are high:
    Alternate signals with timed switching

Add:
- Animated traffic light with soft glow.
- Smooth transitions between red/yellow/green.
- AI Decision Panel explaining why signal changed.

UI Requirements:

Design a modern, soft, premium Smart Traffic AI dashboard.

Style:
- Dark navy gradient background
- Minimal glass effect
- Soft indigo accent
- Rounded cards (20px)
- Subtle shadows
- No harsh neon glow
- Comfortable for eyes

Layout:
Top header:
   - TrafficAI v2.1
   - System Active badge

Left panel:
   - Image Upload button
   - Pedestrians count (auto-updated)
   - Vehicles count (auto-updated)
   - Peak Hour toggle

Center:
   - Elegant animated traffic signal

Right:
   - AI Decision explanation
   - Traffic Load circular meter
   - Intersection Risk level

Use:
- HTML
- CSS
- Minimal JavaScript
- Clean modern font (Inter or Poppins)
- Smooth hover effects

Make it look like a real startup SaaS dashboard.
